I'm from Gansu Province, China, 

and I'm a ninth grader, studying at Beijing Normal University Qingyang Affiliated School 🏫.

I can use Python 🐍 and Markdown, although I haven't mastered them completely. 

But I've been trying my best to learn, and I'm making progress every day 📚.

In life, I enjoy listening to music 🎵 and riding bicycles 🚴. 

At the same time, I also like to play some games, such as Phigros, Minecraft ⛏️, and more.

Friends, if you like what my doing, please give my repository a star ⭐! Your support means a lot to me.
